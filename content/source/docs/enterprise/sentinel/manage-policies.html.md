# Managing Policies

Sentinel Policies are rules which are enforced on every workspace run to validate the terraform plan and corresponding resources are in compliance with company policies. Policies are made up of a sentinel policy file, a name, and an enforcement level. They are managed at an organization level and a user must be in the organization's owners team to create, edit or delete policies.

To view the policies navigate to the organization's settings page under "Sentinel Policy". From the "Sentinel Policy" section you can view, list, edit, create and delete the policies.

To create a new policy navigate to "Create Policy". Sentinel is designed to enable policy as code. As such, it is recommended to use the Terraform Enterprise UI to manage policy only for demos and simple integrations. For complex integrations, it is [recommended to store Sentinel policies in version control](./integrate-vcs.html).

- **Policy Name**: The name of your policy is used in the UI and Sentinel output. Accepts alphanumeric characters, as well as `-` and `_`. Cannot be modified after creation.
- **Enforcement Mode**: This sets the level to which the policy is enforced when performing a run.
  - **hard-mandatory (cannot override)**: This policy is required on all terraform runs. It cannot be overridden by any users.
  - **soft-mandatory (can override)**: This policy is required. If a terraform plan fails to comply, it can be overridden by a member of the organization owners team.
  - **advisory (logging only)**: This policy will allow the run to continue to an apply in both pass and failures of the policy check.
- **Policy Code**: The [Terraform compatible sentinel](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/app/terraform/) policy which defines the rules for the terraform configurations, states and plans. Please note that custom imports are not available for use in Terraform Enterprise at this time.

Consider integrating with the Terraform Enterprise API in CI to test and upload policy files. In the future, Terraform Enterprise will integrate directly with VCS providers for the Sentinel workflow.
