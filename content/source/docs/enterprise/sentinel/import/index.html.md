# Defining Policies

Sentinel Policies for Terraform are defined using the [Sentinel policy
language](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/). A policy can include
[imports](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/concepts/imports) which enable a
policy to access reusable libraries, external data and functions. Terraform
Enterprise provides three imports to define policy rules for the configuration,
state and plan.

- [tfplan](./tfplan.html) - This provides access to a Terraform plan, the file created as a result of `terraform plan`.  The plan represents the changes that Terraform needs to make to infrastructure to reach the desired state represented by the configuration.
- [tfconfig](./tfconfig.html) - This provides access to a Terraform configuration, the set of "tf" files that are used to describe the desired infrastructure state.
- [tfstate](./tfstate.html) - This provides access to the Terraform state, the file used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration.

-> **Note:** Terraform Enterprise does not currently support custom imports.

## Useful Idioms for Terraform Sentinel Policies

Terraform's internal data formats are complex, which means basic Sentinel policies for Terraform are more verbose than basic policies that use simpler data sources.

This will improve in future versions of Terraform and Sentinel; in the meantime, be aware of the following idioms as you start writing policies for Terraform.

### To Find Resources, Iterate over Modules

The most basic Sentinel task for Terraform is to enforce a rule on all resources of a given type. Before you can do that, you need to get a collection of all the relevant resources.

The easiest way to do that is to copy a function like the following into any policies that examine every resource in a configuration:

```python
import "tfplan"

# Get an array of resource bodies of the given type (each body indexed by count),
# collected from all modules. (Returns an empty array if none found).
# Outline of structure:
# [ {"0": {"applied": {"instance_type": "..."}, "diff": {...}}, "1": {...}},
#   {"0": {...}},
#   ... ]
get_resources = func(type) {
    instances = []
    if length(tfplan.module_paths else []) > 0 { # always true in the real tfplan import
        for tfplan.module_paths as path {
            instances += values(tfplan.module(path).resources[type]) else []
        }
    } else { # fallback for tests
        instances += values(tfplan.resources[type]) else []
    }
    return instances
}
```

-> **Note:** This example uses the tfplan import. You can easily substitute tfconfig or tfstate, depending on your needs.

Later, use the function to get a collection of resources:

```python
aws_instances = get_resources("aws_instance")
```

This example function handles several things that are tricky about finding resources:

- It checks every module for resources (including the root module) by looping over the `module_paths` namespace. The top-level `resources` namespace is more convenient, but it only reveals resources from the root module.
- It uses `else` expressions to recover from `undefined` values, for modules that don't have any resources of that type.
- It falls back to the `resources` namespace if the real tfplan import isn't available, to support [testing](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/writing/testing). Since current versions of Sentinel don't allow you to mock tfplan's `module()` function, it isn't possible to test Sentinel code that accesses non-root modules. However, you can still test the rest of the policy by mocking resource data under the `resources` namespace.

-> **Note:** This example is checking whether it's in a test by looking for an empty `module_paths` namespace, which assumes that our organization is omitting that key in our mock data for Sentinel tests. For policies that need to test mocked `module_paths` data for other purposes, you might need to use a different method to check for the real Terraform imports.

### To Test Resources, Use Nested `all` or `any` Expressions

Once you have a collection of resources, you usually want to test some property of each resource in the collection â€” for example, the planned final value of a particular resource attribute.

Because resource bodies in the Terraform imports are deeply nested, you usually need to use nested [`all` or `any` expressions](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/boolexpr#any-all-expressions) to check a resource attribute. For example:

```python
# Allowed Types
allowed_types = [
    "t2.small",
    "t2.medium",
    "t2.large",
]

# Rule to restrict instance types
instance_type_allowed = rule {
    all aws_instances as _index, instances {
        all instances as _count, resource_body {
            resource_body.applied.instance_type in allowed_types
        }
    }
}
```

-> **Note:** It can be easier to keep track of the levels of nesting if you use the two-identifier form of these expressions (`all instances as _count, resource_body`), even if you don't plan to use the hash key or the array index.
