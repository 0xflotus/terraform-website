# About Terraform Runs in Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise (TFE) provides a central interface for running Terraform within a large collaborative organization. If you're accustomed to running Terraform from your workstation, the way TFE manages runs can be unfamiliar.

This page describes the basics of what a run is in TFE. Once you understand the basics, you can read about:

- The [UI/VCS-driven run workflow](./run-ui.html), which is TFE's primary mode of operation.
- The [API-driven run workflow](./run-api.html), which is more flexible but requires you to create some tooling.
- The [CLI-driven run workflow](./run-cli.html), which is the API-driven workflow with a user-friendly command line tool.

## Plans and Applies

TFE enforces Terraform's division between _plan_ and _apply_ operations. It always plans first, saves the plan's output, and uses that output for the apply. In the default configuration, it waits for user approval before running an apply, but you can configure workspaces to automatically apply successful plans.

## Network Access to VCS and Infrastructure Providers

In order to perform Terraform runs, TFE needs network access to all of the resources being managed by Terraform.

If you are using the SaaS version of TFE, this means your VCS provider and any private infrastructure providers you manage with Terraform (including VMware vSphere, OpenStack, other private clouds, and more) _must be internet accessible._

Private installs of TFE must have network connectivity to any connected VCS providers or managed infrastructure providers.

## Runs and Workspaces

TFE always performs Terraform runs in the context of a [workspace](./index.html). The workspace provides the state and variables for the run, and usually specifies where the configuration should come from.

Each workspace in TFE maintains its own queue of runs, and processes those runs in order.

Whenever a new run is requested, it's added to the end of the queue. If there's already a run in progress, the new run won't start until the current one has completely finished — TFE won't even plan the run yet, because the current run might change what a future run would do. Runs that are waiting for other runs to finish are in a _pending_ state, and a workspace might have any number of pending runs.

When you request a run, TFE locks the run to the current Terraform code (usually associated with a specific VCS commit) and variable values. If you change variables or commit new code before the run finishes, it will only affect future runs, not ones that are already pending, planning, or awaiting apply.

## Run States

Each run passes through several stages of action (pending, plan, policy check, apply, and completion), and TFE shows the progress through those stages as run states.

In the list of workspaces on TFE's main page, each workspace shows the state of the run it's currently processing. (Or, if no run is in progress, the state of the most recent completed run.)

For full details about the stages of a run under TFE, see [Run States and Stages](./states.html).

## Interacting with Runs

Each workspace has three always-visible tools for working with runs:

- A "Queue Plan" button, in the upper right.
- A "Runs" link, which goes to the full list of runs.
- A "Latest Run" link, which goes to the most recent _completed_ run. (Completed runs are in an "applied," "discarded," or "plan errored" state.)

From the list of runs, you can click to view or interact with an individual run.

### The Run Page

An individual run page shows the progress and outcomes of each stage of the run.

![a run page](./images/runs-run-page.png)

Most importantly, it shows:

- The current status of the run.
- The code commit associated with the run.
- How the run was triggered, when, and which user requested it (if applicable).
- A timeline of events related to the run.
- The output from both the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands, if applicable. You can hide or reveal these as needed; they default to visible if the command is currently running, and hidden if the command has finished.

If the run is still in progress and you have write access to the workspace, there are controls for interacting with the run at the bottom of the page. Depending on the state of the run, the following buttons might be available:

- A "Cancel Run" button, if a plan or apply is currently running.
- "Confirm & Apply" and "Discard Plan" buttons, if a plan needs confirmation.
- An "Override Policy" button, if a soft-mandatory policy failed (only available for owners team).

## Locking Workspaces (Preventing Runs)

If you need to temporarily stop runs from being queued, you can lock the workspace.

You can find the lock button in the workspace settings page. Locking a workspace requires write or admin access.
