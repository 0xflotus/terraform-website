# Login with SAML

Once SAML is configured users can visit `https://<YOUR_TERRAFORM_ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN>/session` to login.

They can follow the link to complete the SAML login process with the identity provider. If the user is logging in for the first time, an account will be created from them in Terraform Enterprise.
