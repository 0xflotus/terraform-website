Please see our [Upgrading From Terraform Enterprise (Legacy)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/upgrade/index.html) guide to migrate to the new Terraform Enterprise.

Users are the main identity system in Terraform Enterprise. A user can be a
member of multiple [organizations](/docs/enterprise-legacy/organizations/index.html),
as well as individually collaborate on various resources.
