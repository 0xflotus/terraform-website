# Add credit card details to an organization

!> **Deprecation warning**: Terraform Enterprise (Legacy) features of Atlas will no longer be actively developed or maintained and will be fully decommissioned on Thursday, May 31, 2018. Please see our [Upgrading From Terraform Enterprise (Legacy)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/upgrade/index.html) guide to migrate to the new Terraform Enterprise.

To setup automated billing for your Terraform usage, you must add a credit card
to your organization's account. To do so, go into your account settings, then go
to the proper organization settings in the left navigation. Select billing in
the organization settings, and then enter your credit card information.

If you have any questions regarding billing or payment, contact [sales@hashicorp.com](mailto:sales@hashicorp.com).
