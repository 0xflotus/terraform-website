# Organizations in Terraform Enterprise

!> **Deprecation warning**: Terraform Enterprise (Legacy) features of Atlas will no longer be actively developed or maintained and will be fully decommissioned on Thursday, May 31, 2018. Please see our [Upgrading From Terraform Enterprise (Legacy)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/upgrade/index.html) guide to migrate to the new Terraform Enterprise.

Organizations are a group of users in Terraform Enterprise that have access and
ownership over shared resources. When operating within a team, we recommend
creating an organization to manage access control, auditing, billing and
authorization.

Each individual member of your organization should have their own account.
