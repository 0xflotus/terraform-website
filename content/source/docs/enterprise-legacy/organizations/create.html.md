# Create an Organization Account

!> **Deprecation warning**: Terraform Enterprise (Legacy) features of Atlas will no longer be actively developed or maintained and will be fully decommissioned on Thursday, May 31, 2018. Please see our [Upgrading From Terraform Enterprise (Legacy)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/upgrade/index.html) guide to migrate to the new Terraform Enterprise.

To create an organization:

1. Create a personal account. You'll use this to create and administrate the
organization. You'll be able to add other users as owners of the organization,
so it won't be tied solely to your account.

1. Visit your new organization page to create the organization.
