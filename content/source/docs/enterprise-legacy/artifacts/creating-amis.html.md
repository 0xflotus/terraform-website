# Creating AMI Artifacts with Packer and Terraform Enterprise

!> **Deprecation warning**: The Packer, Artifact Registry and Terraform Enterprise (Legacy) features of Atlas will no longer be actively developed or maintained and will be fully decommissioned on Thursday, May 31, 2018. Please see our [Upgrading From Terraform Enterprise (Legacy)](/docs/enterprise/upgrade/index.html) guide to migrate to the new Terraform Enterprise and our [guide on building immutable infrastructure with Packer on CI/CD](https://www.packer.io/guides/packer-on-cicd/) for ideas on implementing the Packer and Artifact features yourself.

Currently, the best way to create AWS AMI artifacts is with Packer.

We detail how to do this in the [Packer section of the documentation](/docs/enterprise-legacy/packer/artifacts/creating-amis.html).
