# Creating AMI Artifacts with Packer and Terraform Enterprise

-> **Deprecation warning**:  The Packer and Artifact Registry features of Atlas will no longer be actively developed or maintained and will be fully decommissioned on Friday, March 30, 2018. Please see our [guide on building immutable infrastructure with Packer on CI/CD](https://www.packer.io/guides/packer-on-cicd/) for ideas on implementing these features yourself.

Currently, the best way to create AWS AMI artifacts is with Packer.

We detail how to do this in the [Packer section of the documentation](/docs/enterprise-legacy/packer/artifacts/creating-amis.html).
