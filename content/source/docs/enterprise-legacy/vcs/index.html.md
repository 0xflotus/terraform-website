# Integration with Version Control Software

!> **Deprecation warning**: Terraform Enterprise (Legacy) features of Atlas will no longer be actively developed or maintained and will be fully decommissioned on Thursday, May 31, 2018. Please see our [Upgrading From Terraform Enterprise (Legacy)](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/upgrade/index.html) guide to migrate to the new Terraform Enterprise.

Terraform Enterprise can integrate with your version control software to
automatically execute Terraform with your latest Terraform configuration as you
commit changes to source control.

Different capabilities within Terraform Enterprise are available depending on
the integration in use. The available integration options are on the sidebar
navigation.
