# Terraform Cloud

This is the documentation for Terraform Cloud.

[Terraform Cloud](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/) is an application that helps teams use Terraform together. It manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment, and includes easy access to shared state and secret data, access controls for approving changes to infrastructure, a private registry for sharing Terraform modules, detailed policy controls for governing the contents of Terraform configurations, and more.

Terraform Cloud is available as a hosted service at [https://app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io). We offer free accounts for small teams, and paid plans with additional feature sets for medium-sized businesses.

Large enterprises can purchase [Terraform Enterprise](/docs/enterprise/index.html), our on-premise distribution of Terraform Cloud. It offers enterprises a private instance of the Terraform Cloud application, with no resource limits and with additional enterprise-grade architectural features like audit logging and SAML single sign-on.

## Who is This For?

The Terraform Cloud documentation is for everyone who uses the Terraform Cloud application to provision and manage infrastructure. This includes Terraform Enterprise users, since the core application of Terraform Enterprise is still Terraform Cloud.

If you are new to Terraform Cloud, begin with the
[Getting Started Guide](./getting-started/access.html).
